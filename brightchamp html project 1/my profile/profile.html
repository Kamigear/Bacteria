			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily. She had a special routine every day. In the morning, she would wake up, brush her teeth, and eat a healthy breakfast. Then, she would put on her favorite dress and go to school.After school, she would play outside with her friends and ride her bike. When it was time for dinner, Lily would wash her hands, sit at the table, and eat her vegetables. Finally, before bed, she would read a bedtime story and give her mom a big hug. Lily loved her daily habits and they made her feel happy and proud.</p>
