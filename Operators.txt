Arithmetic Operators:
+ (Addition): Used for addition of two numbers or concatenation of strings.
- (Subtraction): Used for subtraction of two numbers.
* (Multiplication): Used for multiplication of two numbers.
/ (Division): Used for division of two numbers.
% (Modulus): Returns the remainder of division between two numbers.
++ (Increment): Increases the value of a variable by 1.
-- (Decrement): Decreases the value of a variable by 1.

Assignment Operators:
= (Assignment): Assigns a value to a variable.
+= (Addition Assignment): Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result to the variable.
-= (Subtraction Assignment): Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result to the variable.
*= (Multiplication Assignment): Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.
/= (Division Assignment): Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.
%= (Modulus Assignment): Calculates the modulus of a variable with a value and assigns the result to the variable.

Comparison Operators:
== (Equal to): Checks if two values are equal.
!= (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.
> (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
< (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
>= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
<= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
Logical Operators:
&& (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true.
|| (Logical OR): Returns true if either of the operands is true.
! (Logical NOT): Negates a boolean value.
These are just a few examples of operators in JavaScript. There are additional operators like bitwise operators (&, |, ^, etc.) and string operators (+ for string concatenation), among others. Understanding and utilizing operators is crucial for performing various operations and making logical decisions in JavaScript programming.
